# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

My name is Michael. I'm born and raised in South Carolina. I moved to the DMV in March 2018 after spending four years in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm currently a Consultant at the #1 Risk and Financial Advisory firm in the world (:p). I decided to take a journey and learn Python in 2019. I'm partially excited and partially afraid, however, I'm keeping my head held high and looking forward to see where this journey takes me.
